# Remote Delegates in C++
A C++ standards compliant delegate library capable of invoking a callable delegate function on a remote system. 

An extension of the library originally published on CodeProject at: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1160934/Asynchronous-Multicast-Delegates-in-Cplusplus"><strong>Asynchronous Multicast Delegates in C++</strong></a>

The remote delegates library extensions work on any C++ compiler, however the examples showing usage over UDP sockets execute on Windows only.
